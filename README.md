Project Overview

This project focuses on building a modern SQL data warehouse from scratch. The goal is to consolidate sales and operational data, enabling analytical reporting and data-driven decision-making. Using the Medallion architecture, the data warehouse will be designed to ensure high data quality, scalability, and optimized query performance.

About Me

I am a backend developer and software engineer passionate about data engineering and analytics. This project is a hands-on learning experience that will enhance my skills in SQL, ETL processes, data modeling, and data warehouse architecture. By the end of this project, I aim to:

Gain expertise in designing and implementing a data warehouse.

Develop skills in data transformation and pipeline automation.

Improve proficiency in SQL for data processing and reporting.

Build a professional portfolio project showcasing my abilities in data engineering.

## Project Goals

Design and Architecture: Implement the Medallion architecture with Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.

Data Ingestion: Load raw data into the data warehouse from various sources.

Data Transformation: Clean and process raw data into structured formats suitable for analytics.

Data Modeling: Create optimized schemas for analytical reporting.

Performance Optimization: Ensure efficient query execution for reporting and visualization.

Testing and Validation: Implement data quality checks and validation processes.
